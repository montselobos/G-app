                    <h3> Scenario: <span>Bussiness trip getting to the hotel late night.</span></h3>
                    <p>
                    



Jon is on a business trip. He arrives late at night to SF to meet his clients the next morning. Flying from the East Coast, he usually worries as he double-checks that his alarm is in the right time-zone. Moreover, he usually sets the room's alarm as a backup, but these clocks are always hard to figure out. </p>
<p>As always, he finds the room a bit too cold. He sets the thermostat, but he knows it's going to take a while to get warmer. He decides to wait until it's warmer before getting in the shower. He turns the TV on and tries to find his favorite channels. He switches channels for a while without really watching anything and he gets into the shower. He goes to bed and checks the alarm again. The room is still too cold for him.
